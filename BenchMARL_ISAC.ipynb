This might be a property of a costly general critic training, that however if trained beter generalises the environment then an agent-specified ones.

Interesting part that could be observed is relative stability of the maximal rewards earned by the algorithms, as they do not incorporate mostly the very swingy collision penalties: worth pointing out is a relative competitivness of both algorithms on steps between 150 and 300. This moment in time could probably be the one, where global MASAC critic hasn't learned to avoid collisions reliably yet while ISAC independent critics were able to optimize the attraction fields coverage navigation."

In stage between 100-150 steps the interesting behaviour is exhibited by an entropy where agents entropy has polarized from around 1 to -1 as their policies during training emerged.

However, all the other statistics show clear supriority of the MASAC outcomes, even if it was not able to reach objective, the ISAC means were imposing too much losses. By the step 100, the MSAC confidently outperformed ISAC in reward collection in all fields: min, mean and max.
