Good agents rewarded based on how close one of them is to the target landmark, but negatively rewarded if the adversary is close to target landmark. Adversary is rewarded based on how close it is to the target, but it doesn’t know which landmark is the target landmark. So good agents have to learn to ‘split up’ and cover all landmarks to deceive the adversary.\n",

This might be a property of a costly general critic training, that however if trained beter generalises the environment then an agent-specified ones.

The normalized loss gradients of both critic and actor in MASAC show signinficantly higher values, presumably due to high awarness and therefore incorporation of the collision penalty. One can also observe the expected Q-value (critic) is more reliable within centralized critic (MASAC), probably because of the collision loss effective modeling.

After the 250 steps, it has reliably been delivering better mean results then ISAC, have also mostly been outperforming the other algorithm within minimum reward (except some hicup on step 400 evaluation - probably a collision penalty). Interesting part that could be observed is relative stability of the maximal rewards earned by the algorithms, as they do not incorporate mostly the very swingy collision penalties: worth pointing out is a relative competitivness of both algorithms on steps between 150 and 300. This moment in time could probably be the one, where global MASAC critic hasn't learned to avoid collisions reliably yet while ISAC independent critics were able to optimize the attraction fields coverage navigation."

What is interesting, the high entropy was expected to be shown during ISAC analysis, but apparently the dirastic changes to a learning central critic has forced individual actors to adapt on the fly. In stage between 100-150 steps the interesting behaviour is exhibited by an entropy where agents entropy has polarized from around 1 to -1 as their policies during training emerged. ISAC was the first algorithm to start optimizing around entropy, while MASAC was still presumably trying to model the collision influence.

However, all the other statistics show clear supriority of the MASAC outcomes, even if it was not able to reach objective, the ISAC means were imposing too much losses. By the step 100, the MSAC confidently outperformed ISAC in reward collection in all fields: min, mean and max. Thus it could have been learned that paramisation of the environment had clear restrictions on collisions, to which central critic was able to adapt much better then the individuals."
