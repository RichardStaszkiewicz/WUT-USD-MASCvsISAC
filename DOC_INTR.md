### Software
#### BenchMARL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Library
BenchMARL is Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) library focused on standardized benchmarking across a variety of algorithms and environments. Its mission is to present a standardized interface that allows easy integration of new algorithms and environments to provide a fair comparison with existing solutions. Core design principles include:

- **Reproducibility**: Achieved through systematic grounding and standardization of configuration.
- **Standardized Reporting**: Strong plotting and reporting.
- **Modular Experimentation**: Experiments that are independent of the algorithm, environment, and model choices.
- **Broad MARL Ecosystem Coverage**: Breadth over the MARL ecosystem.
- **Ease of Integration**: Easy implementation of new algorithms, environments, and models.
- **TorchRL Integration**: Leveraging the know-how and infrastructure of TorchRL, without reinventing the wheel.

#### MeltingPot
Melting Pot evaluates how well agents generalize to new social environments, including interactions with both known and unfamiliar individuals. It was designed to test a broad range of social interactions including cooperation, competition, reciprocation, stubbornness and trust. Melting Pot offers researchers a set of over 50 multi-agent reinforcement learning substrates (multi-agent games) and over 256 unique test scenarios for evaluation. The performance of agents on test scenarios allows to assess agents in:

- **Adaptability**: Perform well across a range of social situations where individuals are interdependent.
- **Interpersonal Generalization**: Interact effectively with unfamiliar individuals not seen during training.
